# Accent-App

Accent is an e-commerce app made in a React.js course.
Bootstrapped with [create react app](https://create-react-app.dev/)

## Demo
You can run a demo of the app here:
[netlify.app](https://accent-app.netlify.app) (Product images wont load because the components where linked locally).

It may not load any component except the hero image and the NavBar. If that happens it's because the quota of Firebase was exceeded and you will have to wait for it to go back online (usually the quota re-starts at 00:00 Pacific Time)
